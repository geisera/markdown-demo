# About the Markdown Demo, by Tony Geiser

This demo is a project by Tony Geiser meant to serve as an introduction to Markdown, the simple and easy-to-use markup language you can use to format virtually any document. 

**This is not an exhaustive examination of Markdown, nor a tutorial. But, I hope it will serve as a demo of what it is. And what I can do with Markdown.**

For a complete manual, visit **The Markdown Guide** at [markdownguide.org](https://markdownguide.org)  

<Note>
  This project was built with Next.js, Tailwind, and a flavor of Markdown called, **MDX**.

  **MDX** syntax combines markdown with JSX. This gives us something along the lines of literate programming. It also gives us an odd mix of two languages: markdown is **whitespace sensitive** and **forgiving** (what you type may not exactly work but it wonâ€™t crash) whereas JavaScript is **whitespace insensitive** and **unforgiving** (it ***does*** crash on typos).

  Weirdly enough we quite like how they combine!

  Learn more about MDX [**here**](https://mdxjs.com).
