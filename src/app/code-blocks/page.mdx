# Code Blocks and Syntax highlighting

This guide explores how to apply syntax highlighting to code blocks. MDX supports standard markdown syntax (CommonMark). It does not apply syntax highlighting to code blocks by default.

There are two ways to accomplish syntax highlighting: at compile time or at runtime. Doing it at compile time means the effort is spent upfront so that readers will have a fast experience as no extra code is sent to them (***syntax highlighting needs a lot of code to work***). Doing it at runtime gives more flexibility by moving the work to the client. This can result in a slow experience for readers though. It also depends on what framework you use (as in it’s specific to React, Preact, Vue, etc.) {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Basic code blocks

You can render basic code blocks by placing them between three tick marks as below.

\```
\
bash {{ title: 'An example code block' }}
curl https://someapi.com/v1/endpoint \
  -u username:password
\
\```

**The rendered output looks like this:**

```bash {{ title: 'An example code block' }}
curl https://someapi.com/v1/endpoint \
  -u username:password
```
## More blocks with mock code and documentation:

<Row>
  <Col>

    In this example, we request the page that starts after the conversation with id `s4WycXedwhQrEFuM`. As a result, we get a list of three conversations and can tell by the `has_more` attribute that we have reached the end of the resultset.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="starting_after" type="string">
        The last ID on the page you're currently on when you want to fetch the next page.
      </Property>
      <Property name="ending_before" type="string">
        The first ID on the page you're currently on when you want to fetch the previous page.
      </Property>
      <Property name="limit" type="integer">
        Limit the number of items returned.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
  <Col>

    ```bash {{ title: 'Manual pagination using cURL' }}
    curl -G https://api.Markdown.chat/v1/conversations \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
      -d starting_after="s4WycXedwhQrEFuM" \
      -d limit=10
    ```

    ```json {{ title: 'Paginated response' }}
    {
      "has_more": false,
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "WAz8eIbvDR60rouK",
          // ...
        },
        {
          "id": "hSIhXBhNe8X1d8Et"
          // ...
        },
        {
          "id": "fbwYwpi9C2ybt6Yb"
          // ...
        }
      ]
    }

## Complex code blocks with multiple code samples in each


<Row>
  <Col>

    This endpoint allows you to retrieve a paginated list of all your contacts. By default, a maximum of ten contacts are shown per page.

    ### One more, for good measure

    <Properties>
      <Property name="limit" type="integer">
        Limit the number of contacts returned.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
  <Col sticky>

    <CodeGroup title="Request" tag="GET" label="/v1/contacts">

    ```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
    curl -G https://api.Markdown.chat/v1/contacts \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
      -d active=true \
      -d limit=10
    ```

    ```js
    import ApiClient from '@example/Markdown-api'

    const client = new ApiClient(token)

    await client.contacts.list()
    ```

    ```python
    from Markdown_api import ApiClient

    client = ApiClient(token)

    client.contacts.list()
    ```

    ```php
    $client = new \Markdown\ApiClient($token);

    $client->contacts->list();
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    ```json {{ title: 'Response' }}
    {
      "has_more": false,
      "data": [
        {
          "id": "WAz8eIbvDR60rouK",
          "username": "FrankMcCallister",

        },
        {
