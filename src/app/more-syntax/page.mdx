# More Syntax

Let's look at a bit more commonly used Markdown.

## Tables

To add a table, use three or more hyphens `---` to create each column’s header, and use pipes `|` to separate each column. For compatibility, you should also add a pipe on either end of the row.

|  Heading    |  Another Heading  |<br></br>
|   :---    | :---: |<br></br>
|  Some value  | Another value |

**The rendered output looks like this:**
|  Heading    |  Another Heading  |
|   :---    | :--- |
|  Some value  | Another value |

## Escaping Pipe Characters in Tables

You can display a pipe `|` character in a table by using its HTML character code `&#124;`.

**The rendered output looks like this:** &#124;

## Strikethrough

You can strikethrough words by putting a horizontal line through the center of them. The result looks like this. This feature allows you to indicate that certain words are a mistake not meant for inclusion in the document. To strikethrough words, use two tilde symbols (~~) before and after the words.

\~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.

**The rendered output looks like this:**

~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.;

## Task Lists

Task lists (also referred to as checklists and todo lists) allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes. In Markdown applications that support task lists, checkboxes will be displayed next to the content. To create a task list, add dashes `-` and brackets with a space `[ ]` in front of task list items. To select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets `[x]`.

\- [x] Write the press release<br></br>
\- [ ] Update the website<br></br>
\- [ ] Contact the media

**The rendered output looks like this:**
- [x] Write the press release
- [ ] Update the website
- [ ] Contact the media

## Automatic URL Linking

Many Markdown processors automatically turn URLs into links. That means if you type `http://www.example.com`, your Markdown processor will automatically turn it into a link even though you haven’t used brackets.

**The rendered output looks like this:**

http://www.example.com
