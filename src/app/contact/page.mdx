    Salesforce Consultant | December 2022 - Present

    I was privileged to be part of a team working to undo a botched CPQ roll-out in a complex, telecom enterprise environment. Together we were able to restore sane product catalog, pricing, quoting, MACD and order practices and helped our client realize an ROI on their Salesforce investment. And many other projects.

    Director of Aircraft Maintenance | 2014 – 2022| CTI Professional Flight Training, Millington, TN
- I ensured aircraft were maintained in a safe and regulatory compliant manner through attention to detail, knowledge of Federal Aviation Administration regulations, and my own integrity.
- As a Technical Writer I wrote and maintained our Quality and Maintenance Manuals used as a practical tool for maintenance personnel and legally compliant to FAA inspectors.
- These manuals require rigorous research and preparation in order to pass federal inspection and constant monitoring for quality, accuracy, and usefulness for the intended audience.
